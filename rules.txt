0.  Read all the problems!
1.  Use meaningful variable names (no nonsense like vvv, aa, asdf).
2.  Use plenty of empty lines for better code legibility.
3.  Tabs should be no less than 2 spaces, and no more than 4 spaces.
4.  Always use braces, unless the statement is on the same line as the conditional. 
5.  Do not use the comma operator.
6.  Use cerr for debug statements.
7.  Do not delete debug statements, comment them out instead.
8.  Use an init() function to initialize variables if needed.
9.  Always test with input files.
10. Always test with more than just the sample.
11. Always reread the code before submitting.
12. Do the math on paper.
13. Write dp transitions on paper.
14. Use arrays instead of vectors for dp.
15. Avoid using pairs, define structs instead.
16. The variable T is reserved for test cases or similar. 
17. The variables N, M, K are reserved for limits.
18. Other single letter variables are reserved for input or temporary.
19. In geometry, p is reserved for a vector of points.
20. Pray harder.
